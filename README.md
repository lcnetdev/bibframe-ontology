# Overview
Initiated by the Library of Congress, BIBFRAME provides a foundation for the future 
of bibliographic description, both on the web, and in the broader networked world 
that is grounded in Linked Data techniques. A major focus of the initiative is to 
determine a transition path for the MARC 21 formats while preserving a robust
data exchange that has supported resource sharing and cataloging cost savings 
in recent decades.

## Bibframe Model and Vocabulary
This repository contains the BIBFRAME Vocabulary [bibframe.rdf](bibframe.rdf).
It is intended for tracking issues and changes to the vocabulary.
